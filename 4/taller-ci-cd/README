For your Docker Hub **access token**, choose the **minimum permissions needed** to:

âœ… Authenticate
âœ… Push images

---

### âœ… Recommended: **Read & Write**

This allows the GitHub Action to:

* **Read** existing images (for tag conflicts, etc.)
* **Push** new images (required for your workflow)

---

### ðŸš« Don't use:

* **Public Repo Read-only** â€“ Not enough (you need to push)
* **Read-only** â€“ You wonâ€™t be able to push images
* **Read, Write, Delete** â€“ Too permissive unless you plan to delete images from CI/CD (which you're not doing now)

---

So, **select: `Read & Write`**, and you're good to go. Let me know once it's created so we can keep building!
